# Congressional Gift Data 
If you're like me, you hate xml files, and don't understand why people use them. There's probably somebody out there who does, but it's not me. Anyways, this morning I went to a dope NICAR session that mentioned Congressional Gift Travel data, which is only published in an xml. So, I wrote this code to port the data into a csv. It's not perfect because the senate one currently puts multiple trips for the same employee in the same row sequentially(without repeating any data, don't worry), but it should make the data slightly more manageable. Included are the python scripts and csv files, which are current as of 3/10/2018.
